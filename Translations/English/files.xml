    <Text>March 25th \nLately many of our guys have \nreported missing belongings. \nEspecially smaller items such \nas hand mirrors and watches. \nJust the other day, my \nsilver rocket followed the \nsame fate.  There are rumors \nthat it's the handy work \nof a tiny dinosaur.  It's got {clear}a real jivy name like “Compy” \nor something.{clear}               \n               \n   {pic}           \n               \n               \n               \n               \n               {clear}April 3rd \nToday I heard an interesting \nstory.  Crows and other birds \nhave a peculiar behavior of \ncollecting shiny things. \nIt appears as though these \nCompys may have similar \nbehaviors.  Come to think of \nit all of the missing items \nwere all shiny things.{clear}They seem to have a lot of \nsimilarities with the birds. \nIt could be that they are \ntheir ancestors.  We haven't \nbeen able to capture any of \nthem since they are so quick \non their feet.  But if we use \ntheir behavior to our \nadvantage, then maybe...{clear}April 6th \nWe used a laboratory animal \ncage and were finally able to \ncapture one of them.  We \nused Alan's bracelet as a \nbait and cornered him in.\nThe key to capturing is to\nblock all possible escape \nroutes.{clear}If there is even the smallest \nof gaps they will manage to \nescape.{clear}Our plan is to use this cage \nto get rid of them as fast \nas we can. The Raptors who \neat them for snacks have \nstarted to roam around this \narea.

    <Text>Manager's Diary, Mechanics</Text>
    <Text>June 2nd, 10:30PM \nTomorrow afternoon two \nmechanics are coming to this \nfacility from Edward City. \nIt is time for the annual \nmaintenance check of \nthe 3rd Energy Reactor. \nThis will be the 9th time.{clear}The instant something \nhappens to the underwater \nreactor, that is when all \nlife lines will be cut off \nfrom us.  Again, all we can \ndo is to pray that nothing \nwill happen.{clear}As weird as it may sound,\nsometimes I feel that it'll\ndo us all a favor if that \nreactor just blew up on us.{clear}June 3rd,  4:00PM \nThe mechanics who went to \nthe underwater 3rd Energy \nReactor still have not \nreturned.  They probably \nbecame their lunch.  This is \na problem.  One of the \nmechanics, Bob, has the key \nto the entrance of \nEdward City.{clear}To go from this facility to \nthe city, it is critical that \nwe get back the key. \nI guess there is no real \nchoice but to get in the \ndiving suit and go down \nmyself.  I just hope I don't \nbecome their dinner.</Text>
    <Text>Mechanic's Note</Text>
    <Text>To Bob, \nI heard that you were placed \nin charge of this area. \nAs a present for your new \nposition, here is a memo \nwhich may come in handy. \nIt's about restarting the \npower.{clear}When you try to initialize the \npower restarting program, it \noften stops right?  Well it's \ndue to the malfunctioning of \nthe three control terminals. \nHere are some tips to \noperate it.{clear}When you initialize the \nprogram, it quickly overloads \nand the lamp turns red. \nWell, when that happens all \nyou need to do is just give \nit some electric shock with \nsome kind of tool. \nIt should wake the sucker up. \nAnyway good luck.  See ya. \n                       Mike</Text>
    <Text>Preventative Maintenance</Text>
    <Text>As always, we'll conduct the \npreventative maintenance by \nassigning labor tasks. \nBob will be in charge of \nthe 3rd Energy Reactor \nitself. Alec will be in \ncharge of checking the \nWater Circulation System.{clear}As in previous years for the \nsafety of the mechanics, \nduring maintenance work \nmake sure to close the \nshutters for the cooling \naqueducts.  Alec will unplug \nthe plug which allows \ncontrol of the shutter and \nkeep it until Bob is done \nchecking the reactor.{clear}The other day there was an \nexplosion in the water \ncirculation chamber. \nThis explosion caused a crack \nin one of the concrete \ncolumns.  One more explosion \nwould have probably \ndestroyed it.  Remember to \nrepair that as well.</Text>

    <Text>I underestimated the idea of \ntrying to protect human \nterritory.  The plan to clean \nout the dinosaurs intruding \ninto the city failed. \nThe humans in this world are \nabout to be extinct.{clear}We human should have never \nlaid our hands on 3rd Energy. \nThe military folks still don't \nget it even after all this. \nTheir plan is to fire the \n3rd Energy Missile in this \narea of the jungle and wipe \nthe whole area out.{clear}They plan to take the \n3rd Energy data disk to the \nMissile silo in the Jungle and \ninput the data in the warhead. \nThe missile is scheduled to \nstrike this area at noon \ntomorrow.

    <Text>This is a notification that \nnow all facility keys will be \nmanaged in this control room. \nThe colors of the lock \nterminal corresponds to \nthe colors of the key. \nMatching the colors of the \nkeys and the terminals will \nrelease the security lock.{clear}Due to security reasons, \nonly one key can be removed \nat a time.  Also, the keys' \nelectronic information is \nreprogrammed each week. \nFor this reason always \nreturn the key to the \nKey Control System after \nuse.</Text>
    <Text>Report on Unidentified Body</Text>
    <Text>Another dead body of a \nyouth was carried in today.\nAs suspected he was not a \nresident of Edward City. \nIf this is really true then the \nonly possible conclusion is \nthat he and the others must \nhave come from another time. \nCould such a thing be \npossible?{clear}Over the past few months \nyouths of about 17 or 18 \nyears have appeared and \nbegun attacking us. \n\nCommunication with these \nyouths have not been \nsuccessful, but rather \nimpossible.{clear}               \n               \n   {pic}           \n               \n               \n               \n               \n               {clear}Today we plan to remove one \nof the bodies out of the \npreservation liquid and \nconduct an autopsy. \nThe result of the autopsy \nwill be reported to Colonel\nMaison who is dispatched at \nthe 3rd Energy Facility.</Text>
    <Text>Superintendent's Will</Text>
    <Text>I knew it would all come to \nthis. There's no way humans \nand dinosaur could ever \ncoexist. \nBut if we sacrifice our \nlives now, we would leave \na chance for the existance \nof the human race.{clear}The irony is that this whole \nfacility which we are trapped \nin was built to sustain a \nsuitable enviroment for the \ndinosaurs. \n            \nI am the superintendent of \nthe facility and I'm the only \none left. I don't belong here.{clear}There is no future for this \nworld.  The children hurt by \nthe dinosaurs have been put \ninside life-support chambers. \nI trust that the people of the \n“past” will take care of them. \nThe life-support chambers are \nalmighty.  It should be able \nto heal any wound, no matter \nhow critical they may be.{clear}Also the life-support \nchambers will feed \nknowledge and teach them \nabout this world.  However, \nthe chambers were originally \ndesigned for the growth of \ndinosaurs. Thus the \nknowledge fed will be limited \nto the knowledge of \ncoexisting with the dinosaurs.{clear}The tradegy is that the \nchildren will eventually lose \ntheir speaking ability.  \nInstead their instinct will be \nto protect the dinosaurs. {clear}Today I have recorded my \nmessage for the man who \nwill definitely come here. \nWith this I have nothing \nto regret.</Text>
    <Text>Noah's Ark Plan</Text>
    <Text>Year 2009 \nIt all began in Bolzinia, a \nsmall republic in the southern \nsea.  The first “Overdrive” \nwas the beginning of \neverything. {clear}During transportation \nsomething went wrong and it \nresulted in a crack in the \nspacetime which skewed \nhistory after the \nCretaceous Era.{clear}To investigate the skewed \nbiological history after the \nCretaceous, an extensive \nexperiment was conducted \nin a global scale. \nThe result... devastating.{clear}The “Spacetime skew” would \ntake its effect on all living \norganisms. The Earth's \nhistory would change \ndramatically and the change \nwould wipe the human race \nfrom ever exisiting. \nThat was the conclusion of \nthe experiment.{clear}The plan was to transport the \nliving organisms of the \nCretaceous through the \nTimegate to a world with \nsimilar environments, \nfar into the future. \nAfter the crisis had passed, \nthe organisms would then be \nreturned to their original time. {clear}We called this the Noah's \nArk Plan.{clear}This was the only plan that \nwould leave any chance for \nthe existance of the human \nrace. \nWe hope that this plan is \nsuccessful and we shall \ndeclare execution of this \nplan. \n       WAPP Central Council</Text>
    <Text>Storage Room Items</Text>
    <Text>All instruments and \nmaterials will be transferred \nto the research facility \ntomorrow.  Starting next \nmonth, an extensive \nexperiment will start relating \nto the Timegate.  There just \naren't enough computers to \nsave all the data. {clear}We need as many computers \nas we can gather.{clear}The Timegate's Revival \nProject has hit against a \nwall.  We hope the \nexperiment will bring about \neffective measures. \nGive all Research Facility \nKeys to Lieutenant Wolf \nof the Transport team \ntoday.{clear}The key cards are kept in a \nbox in the wall of this room. \nApproximately 250 people of \nthe soldiers' families have \nbeen moved to the living \nquarters of Edward City \nlast month. \nNow it's all up to us to \nrevive the Timegate.</Text>
    <Text>Researchers Records</Text>
    <Text>The recovery of the Timegate \nseems impossible with the \nlimited instrumentations we \nhave in this world. \nToday was supposed to have \nbeen the last hopeful \nexperiment.  However, the \nlack of instruments have \nstopped us from conducting \nthis experiment.{clear}One week ago, the Transport \nteam lead by Lieutenant Wolf \nwas supposed to bring \nus the instruments for the \nexperiment.  They never \narrived.  Something must \nhave happened in the Military \nFacility.  We still haven't \nbeen able to establish \ncommunication with them.{clear}If we still intend to pursue \nwith the experiment we need \nto go to the Missile Silo \non the other side of the \nsuspension bridge.  But the \nbridge was destroyed in a \nrecent combat.  The only \nother way to the other side \nis through the deadly poison \nzone. {clear}Unfortunately it is far too \ndangerous to even go near \nthe area.{clear}               \n               \n   {pic}           \n               \n               \n               \n               </Text>
